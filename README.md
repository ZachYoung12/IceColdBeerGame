## Overview
- Hike&Hide is a singleplayer side-view platformer game for PC.

## Objective
- The player must traverse up a wall filled with holes, using a platform that lifts from either side to move, each layer of the wall having a glowing hole the player must reach as a "checkpoint".
- The final goal is to reach the top layer of the wall and get the player into the final glowing hole.

## Gameplay
- The player is a controlled using the left and right arrow buttons to lift each side of the platform.
- If one side of the platform is higher than the other the player will begin to roll towards the lower side, in doing so the player will have to avoid the "bad" caves while trying to reach the glowing checkpoint caves.
- If the player rolls into a "bad" cave then an avalance will occur, knocking the player to their last checkpoint, but a glowing cave will keep you safe from the avalance.
- Every five layers of the mountain more "bad" caves will line the layer making it harder to reach the checkpoint.
- The mountain will have different amounts of layers depending on the difficulty, the most being 50.

## Player
- The player character is a sentient snowball hiking up a snowy mountain to become a part of it's peak like the rest of it's family.
