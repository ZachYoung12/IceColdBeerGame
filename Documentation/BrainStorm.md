# Progress
- Today we made a physical prototype for our ramp and decided it will move along with two objects lifting it from the bottom from either side
- We know the ramp will have to eventually be fastened to the objects otherwise it will fall off
- The first step will be to make one object that can move up and down with player input

## What button should it be?
- We know we need to have a keyboard prototype control in order to test the game
- We could use WASD and the arrow keys in order to control the objects, WS in order to move the left side up and down and the up and down arrow keys to move the right side.
